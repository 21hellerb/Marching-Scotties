		<h3 class="important"> The Marching Scotties  </h3>
		<p> The Bordentown Regional Marching Scotties is a group III marching band from the Bordentown Regional High School. We preform at all of our School's football games, home and away, and compete in competitions around the area, including Nationals outside of the state. We are a very important part of our community and a lot of people in Bordentown know of the Scotties from our winning preformances at competitions, from the local parades we do sometimes, or our appearneces in the newspapers. Other things we do for our community include helping them at local events that we are not preforming at. Most of the people in the band have helped at community events to help the city or township of Bordentown. </p>

		<h3 class="important"> Appreciation </h3>
		<p> There are a lot of people to appreciate for helping come up with ideas for this website. Of course, the entire base layout was thought up by myself, Benjamin Heller, and the idea was accepted by Mr. Montalto, but some other students have given suggestions for what THEY want in a website about the band, and I will try to give it to them in the future. For now, you can email me @baheller518@outlook.com or see me in person to submit any suggestions, and there may be a suggestion box in the band room if necessary.</p>
