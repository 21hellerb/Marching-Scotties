		<h3 class="important"> The Marching Scotties  </h3>
		<p> The Bordentown Regional Marching Scotties is a group III marching band from the Bordentown Regional High School. We preform at all of our School's football games, home and away, and compete in competitions around the area, including Nationals outside of the state. We are a very important part of our community and a lot of people in Bordentown know of the Scotties from our winning preformances at competitions, from the local parades we do sometimes, or our appearneces in the newspapers. Other things we do for our community include helping them at local events that we are not preforming at. Most of the people in the band have helped at community events to help the city or township of Bordentown. </p>
